# ARIES

This is a [Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/) based documentation for the use of [ARIES](http://aries.integratedmodelling.org/) (ARtificial Intelligence for Ecosystem Services). We (Manuela and I) took a course two years ago in Bilbao on ARIES, I have been  following the project since then. However, I haven't really used it in any projects. I would like to keep the spark alive, therefore, I am now documenting what I am doing in these pages. It may be useful for someone else too...

## installation
1. You download ARIES or kLab as one of its main components is called [here](https://integratedmodelling.org/collaboration/#/download)
2. Then you follow the instructions [here](https://integratedmodelling.org/confluence/display/LSD/Obtaining+and+installing+the+k.LAB+software)
3. I installed the default code from bitbucket as explained [here](https://github.com/ninbrm/ARIES/files/54150/ThinklabInstallationGuide.pdf) in point 2.16 (note that most of this installation process has become obsolete).

## using K-Lab:
* I start by uploading some data [here](https://github.com/NINAnor/ARIES/blob/master/data.md)
* I then try to "declare" it in my code, fail!
* Useful help can be found [here](https://github.com/NINAnor/ARIES/files/54189/kLAB_help.pdf)
