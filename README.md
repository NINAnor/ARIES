Markdown [here](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/)

I want to document here my experiences with ARIES, or K-Lab as it is now called...

I start by uploading some data [here](https://github.com/ninbrm/ARIES/blob/master/data.md)

## installation
1. You download ARIES [here](https://integratedmodelling.org/collaboration/#/download)
2. Then you follow the instructions [here](https://integratedmodelling.org/confluence/display/LSD/Obtaining+and+installing+the+k.LAB+software)
3. I installed some git code from [here]()
