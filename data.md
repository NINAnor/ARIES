# Data in ARIES
## data upload
Data are uploaded [here](https://integratedmodelling.org/collaboration/#/datamanager/upload).
You can then find the "urn" [here](https://integratedmodelling.org/collaboration/#/datamanager/table), when you try editing the layer.

## inclusion in the project
I am not yet successful at adding the data to a project.

## questions
how do we include data that are in a database?
